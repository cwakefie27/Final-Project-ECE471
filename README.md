# Final-Project-ECE471

My idea for all the python programs is to use gridsearchCV to make finding the optimal parameters easier for us. To test parameters we will just have to put them in the params_grid and it will test all of them and return the best choice. Furthermore, it does this all in parallel and using 10 fold cross validation.

There will potentially be warnings for the performance metrics, ignore them, they do not matter, they come from classes not being predicted at all for a certain class label

Current Issues:

1) To graph or not graph decision tree is hardcoded, maybe make the optional parameter be an int verbose 1 for save predictions, 2 for attempt to make graphs?

TODO:

1) Classifier Fusion
2) ROC curve?
3) Any plots?
