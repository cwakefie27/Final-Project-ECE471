# Final-Project-ECE471

My idea for all the python programs is to use gridsearchCV to make finding the optimal parameters easier for us. To test parameters we will just have to put them in the params_grid.

The next thing to do is figure out how we want classes sectioned (Does illegal drugs vs does not). Make those sections in a python file responsible for parsing in the X_train and y_train to those specs.

Feel free to change my implementations if you see something wrong and do not hesitate to push to the git.
